This repository provides the Matlab code base used to create and run the Auditory-based decision-making behavioral paradigm described
in Tekriwal et al.,.
In addition, we have provided starter code to generate preliminary analyses of the behavioral responses collected with the paradigm.
Finally, we include the 3D stereolithography files needed to print the Wii-nunchuck add-on to restirct movements to the lateral plane.
